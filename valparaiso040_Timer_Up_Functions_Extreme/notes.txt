The function prototype tells your program that a function exists and will be defined later. If you don't have a prototype (or a definition before main) and try to use the function, an error will occur. You can declare as many function prototypes as you need.

You can omit the word void from your function prototype and function definitions. This is commonly done.

No matter how many functions you may add to your C program, the execution will always start at the beginning of main().

Most of the time we use functions, our programs will be slightly larger. However, most developers are willing to suffer a small increase in program size for the convenience of using functions.

Your function may have as many different return statements as you want, but as soon as the program executes one of the return statements, the program will immediatelly leave your function and return to main() (or from wherever your function was called).
