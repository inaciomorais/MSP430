P1DIR Register - Port P1 direction

P1OUT Register - Port P1 output

P1REN Register - Port P1 resistor enable

Input Register PxIN:
Each bit in each PxIN register reflects the value of the input signal at the corresponding I/O pin when the pin is configured as I/O function.
	Bit = 0: The input is low
	Bit = 1: The input is high

Output Registers PxOUT:
Each bit in each PxOUT register is the value to be output on the corresponding I/O pin when the pin is configured as I/O function, output direction, and the pullup/down resistor is disabled.
	Bit = 0: The output is low
	Bit = 1: The output is high

If the pin's pullup/pulldown resistor is enabled, the corresponding bit in the PxOUT register selects pullup or pulldown.
	Bit = 0: The pin is pulled down
	Bit = 1: The pin is pulled up

Direction Registers PxDIR:
Each bit in each PxDIR register selects the direction of the corresponding I/O pin, regardless of the selected function for the pin. PxDIR bits for I/O pins that are selected for other functions must be set as required by the other function.
	Bit = 0: The port pin is switched to input direction
	Bit = 1: The port pin is switched to output direction

Pullup/Pulldown Resistor Enable Registers PxREN:
Each bit in each PxREN register enables or disables the pullup/pulldown resistor of the corresponding I/O pin. The corresponding bit in the PxOUT register selects if the pin is pulled up or pulled down.
	Bit = 0: Pullup/pulldown resistor disabled
	Bit = 1: Pullup/pulldown resistor enabled

All of the pins are defaulted to be inputs (PxDIR = 0b00000000;).

If the value is non-zero, it is always taken as true.

Configuring Unused Port Pins

Unused I/O pins should be configured as I/O function, output direction, and left unconnected on the PC board, to prevent a floating input and reduce power consumption. The value of the PxOUT bit is irrelevant, since the pin is unconnected. Alternatively, the integrated pullup/pulldown resistor can be enabled by setting the PxREN bit of the unused pin to prevent the floating input.
