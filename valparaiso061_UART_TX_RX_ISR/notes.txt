Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter

UART peripherals are asynchronous in nature. The peripheral  does not use a common clock signal to synchronize two devices that are communicating with each other.

We transmit the byte of data we want to send by storing it in a 'transmission buffer' register.

9600 baud = 9600 bits per second 

1/9600 = 104us

The UART standard requires the transmission pin to remain HI when data is not being transmitted. Next, the UART standard requires to send out a start bit prior to sending out the intended data. Since the line will be HI prior to data transmission, the start bit will be LO. This transmission from HI to LO indicates to all the devices listening to the UART bus that a new byte of information will be sent. After the start bit, the UART peripheral sends the data. The universal UART standard sends the least significant bit first. Therefore, the UART transmits the bits in reverse order. After the last bit of data is sent, the UART peripheral terminates the message by sending a stop bit. After the stop bit, the UART ensures the TX line remains HI until the next message is ready to be sent out. All bits are aproximately 104us longer (9600 baud).

P1.1 - UCA0RXD - USCI_A0 UART mode: receive data input (MSP430FR6989 - P4.3)
P1.2 - UCA0TXD - USCI_A0 UART mode: transmit data output (MSP430FR6989 - P4.2)

In UART mode, the USCI transmits and receives characters at a bit rate asynchronous to another device.
Timing for each character is based on the selected baud rate of the USCI. The transmit and receive
functions use the same baud rate frequency.

The USCI is reset by setting the UCSWRST bit. Clearing UCSWRST releases the USCI for operation.

Initializing or Re-Configuring the USCI Module
The recommended USCI initialization/re-configuration process is:
1. Set UCSWRST (UCAxCTL1)
2. Initialize all USCI registers with UCSWRST = 1 (including UCAxCTL1)
3. Configure ports.
4. Clear UCSWRST via software
5. Enable interrupts (optional) via UCAxRXIE and/or UCAxTXIE

The USCI module is enabled by clearing the UCSWRST bit and the receiver is ready and in an idle state. The falling edge of the start bit enables the baud rate generator and the UART state machine checks for a valid start bit.

The USCI module is enabled by clearing the UCSWRST bit and the transmitter is ready and in an idle state. A transmission is initiated by writing data to UCAxTXBUF. When this occurs, the baud rate generator is enabled and the data in UCAxTXBUF is moved to the transmit shift register on the next BITCLK after the transmit shift register is empty. UCAxTXIFG is set when new data can be written into UCAxTXBUF.

LSB-first is typically required for UART communication.
