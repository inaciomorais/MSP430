WDTCTL, Watchdog Timer+ Register:
Bits 15-8	WDTPW	Watchdog timer+ password. Always read as 069h. Must be written as 05Ah, or a PUC is generated.
Bit 7		WDTHOLD	Watchdog timer+ hold. This bit stops the watchdog timer+. Setting WDTHOLD = 1 when the WDT+ is not in use conserves power.
		0 Watchdog timer+ is not stopped
		1 Watchdog timer+ is stopped

The watchdog timer is a peripheral that can be used to restart your program if it becomes unresponsive. Therefore, if you create a program with the WDT enabled, you have to 'pet' or reset the count on the watchdog to let it know your program is running fine.

WDTCTL is a 16-bit register.

WatchDog Timer CouNTer Clear (WDTCNTCL). You need to make this bit HI to pet the watchdog and start it counting again.

The watchdog peripheral is enabled automatically when the program starts running. That's why we have to disable it for every program. Therefore, to use the watchdog in your program, you don't really have to enable it or start it running.
