ADC - Analog-to-digital converter


1 x 10-Bit 200-ksps Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converter [8 Channels - A0 (P1.0) - A7 (P1.7)]

Vax - Analog input voltage: 0 - Vcc V

The ADC10CLK is used both as the conversion clock and to generate the sampling period. The ADC10 source clock is selected using the ADC10SSELx bits and can be divided from 1 to 8 using the ADC10DIVx bits. Possible ADC10CLK sources are SMCLK, MCLK, ACLK, and internal oscillator ADC10OSC.

The ADC10OSC, generated internally, is in the 5-MHz range (3.7 - 6.3 MHz), but varies with individual devices, supply voltage, and temperature.

The SHTx bits select the sample period tsample to be 4, 8, 16, or 64 ADC10CLK cycles. The sampling timer sets SAMPCON high for the selected sample period after synchronization with ADC10CLK.Total sampling time is tsample plus tsync.The high-to-low SAMPCON transition starts the analog-to-digital conversion, which requires 13 ADC10CLK cycles.

The resistance of the source RS and RI affect tsample.The following equations can be used to calculate the minimum sampling time for a 10-bit conversion.
tsample > (RS + RI) × ln(211) × CI

Substituting the values for RI and CI given above, the equation becomes:
tsample > (RS + 2 kΩ) × 7.625 × 27 pF


1 [s] / (fADC10CLK = fADC10OSC = 5000000 [MHz]) = 0,0000002s

tsample (ADC10SHT)
4  x ADC10CLK =  0,8us
8  x ADC10CLK =  1,6us
16 x ADC10CLK =  3,2us
64 x ADC10CLK = 12,8us

The ADC10 has four operating modes selected by the CONSEQx bits.
00 - Single channel single-conversion - A single channel is converted once.
01 - Sequence-of-channels - A sequence of channels is converted once.
10 - Repeat single channel - A single channel is converted repeatedly.
11 - Repeat sequence-of-channels - A sequence of channels is converted repeatedly.

A single channel selected by INCHx is sampled and converted once. The ADC result is written to ADC10MEM.

Resetting ENC in single-channel single-conversion mode stops a conversion immediately and the results are unpredictable. For correct results, poll the ADC10BUSY bit until reset before clearing ENC.

ADC10IFG is set when conversion results are loaded into ADC10MEM. If both the ADC10IE and the GIE bits are set, then the ADC10IFG flag generates an interrupt request. The ADC10IFG flag is automatically reset when the interrupt request is serviced, or it may be reset by software.
